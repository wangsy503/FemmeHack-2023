## Project: Free Lunch

## Introduction

Welcome to the Free Lunch project! This project is aimed at helping people find free lunch options in the local area and avoid food waste. Whether you're a student on a tight budget, a busy professional with limited time, or just someone who loves a good deal, this project is for you.

## Inspiration

There are many free lunches in events hosted by different departments in University of Pennsylvania. However, the organizers would often order more food than the people can eat, so usually many food will be left and wasted. To solve this, here is the web "looking for free lunch" for people to post and look for other's free lunch posts nearby. People who haven't eat can go to the correspond location after they see one post, and eat the left free food to avoid food waste.

## Features
- Post current free food events, times and locations with additional food descriptions and pictures. 
- Look for the newest events post to quickly know where to eat free food.
- Add comment on the free food to let people know the update of the event status (like food has been eaten out) or more detailed description of the event.

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## What's next

In the future, the web app can be improved by 
- Add event type so people can not only attracted by free food, but also the amazing events
- Filter events by locations or event type
- implementing chat functions of user log-in and real-time chatting, to make the platform more secure and improve the communication efficiency.
